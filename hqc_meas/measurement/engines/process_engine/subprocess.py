class TaskProcess(Process):
    """Process taking care of performing the measures.

    When started this process sets up a logger redirecting all records to a
    queue. It then redirects stdout and stderr to the logging system. Then as
    long as it is not stopped it waits for the main process to send a
    measures through the pipe. Upon reception of the `ConfigObj` object
    describing the measure it rebuilds it, set up a logger for that specific
    measure and if necessary starts a spy transmitting the value of all
    monitored entries to the main process. It finally run the checks of the
    measure and run it. It can be interrupted by setting an event and upon
    exit close the communication pipe and signal all listeners that it is
    closing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pipe : double ended multiprocessing pipe
        Pipe used to communicate with the parent process which is transferring
        the measure to perform.
    log_queue : multiprocessing queue
        Queue in which all log records are sent to be procesed later in the
        main process.
    monitor_queue : multiprocessing queue
        Queue in which all the informations the user asked to monitor during
        the measurement are sent to be processed in the main process.
    task_pause : multiprocessing event
        Event set when the user asked the running measurement to pause.
    task_paused : multiprocessing event
        Event set when the current measure is paused.
    task_stop : multiprocessing event
        Event set when the user asked the running measurement to stop.
    process_stop : multiprocessing event
        Event set when the user asked the process to stop.

    Attributes
    ----------
    meas_log_handler : log handler
        Log handler used to save the running measurement specific records.
    see `Parameters`

    Methods
    -------
    run():
        Method called when the new process starts.
